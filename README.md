#  Design Document: semantic movie recommender

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the design of a Semantic Movie Recommender. The goal is to help users discover movies they are likely to enjoy based on their description of the movie.
### 1.2 Scope
Initial dataset: [TMDB 5000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data) 5000 movies from the website The Movie Database

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

- User login/signup and profile management  
- Rating system (e.g., 1–5 stars or thumbs up/down)  
- Movie browsing with genres, cast, release year, etc.  
- Personalized movie recommendations  
- Trending and popular movies list  
- Search functionality  
- Watchlist feature  

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- Low-latency recommendation generation  
- Scalable to millions of users and movies  
- Secure handling of user data  
- High availability and fault tolerance  
- Modular and extensible architecture

## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 High-Level Diagram


---

## 5. Data Sources

### 5.1 Internal

- User ratings and interaction history  
- Watchlists and user metadata  

### 5.2 External

- MovieLens dataset (for bootstrapping)  
- IMDb/OMDb APIs for metadata enrichment  

---

## 6. Recommendation Algorithms

### 6.1 Collaborative Filtering (CF)
- **User-Based CF**: Recommend based on similar users  
- **Item-Based CF**: Recommend based on similar movies  

### 6.2 Content-Based Filtering
- Use movie genres, directors, cast, descriptions  

### 6.3 Hybrid Approach
- Combine CF and content-based using weighted average or stacking  

### 6.4 Advanced Techniques (optional)
- Matrix factorization (e.g., SVD)  
- Deep Learning (e.g., autoencoders, Transformers)  
- Reinforcement Learning (for sequential recommendations)

## 7. Data Pipeline

1. Ingestion (user ratings, movie metadata)  
2. ETL/cleaning (handle missing data, normalize formats)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model training and evaluation  
5. Batch/real-time inference  
6. Logging for feedback loop  

---

## 8. Storage

- **User Data**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB  
- **Movie Metadata**: PostgreSQL or Elasticsearch  
- **Logs**: Amazon S3 or BigQuery  
- **Model Store**: MLflow or custom artifact store

## 9. APIs

| Endpoint           | Method | Description                      |
|--------------------|--------|----------------------------------|
| `/recommend`       | GET    | Get personalized recommendations |
| `/rate`            | POST   | Submit movie rating              |
| `/search`          | GET    | Search for movies                |
| `/movie/<id>`      | GET    | Get movie details                |
| `/trending`        | GET    | Show trending movies             |

---

## 10. Evaluation Metrics

- RMSE / MAE (for explicit ratings)  
- Precision@K / Recall@K / NDCG  
- Coverage, Diversity, Serendipity  
- A/B testing for online performance  

---

## 11. Deployment Plan

- Containerized services (Docker)  
- Kubernetes for orchestration  
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions  
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana  

---

## 12. Future Work

- Social integration (friends’ watch history)  
- Real-time recommendations  
- Cross-platform history synchronization  
- Multilingual support
