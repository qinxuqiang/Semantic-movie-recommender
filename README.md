#  Design Document: semantic movie recommender

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the design of a Semantic Movie Recommender. The goal is to help users discover movies they are likely to enjoy based on their description of the movie.
### 1.2 Scope
Initial dataset: [TMDB 5000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data) 5000 movies from the website The Movie Database

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

- Movie browsing with description using semantic similarity
- Finding directors and actors with fuzzy search
- Movie browsing with genre and release year
- Trending and popular movies list
- Personalized movie functionality
- Search functionality  
- Watchlist feature  

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- Low-latency recommendation generation  
- Scalable to millions of users and movies  
- Secure handling of user data  
- High availability and fault tolerance  
- Modular and extensible architecture

## 5. Data Sources

### 5.1 Internal

- User ratings and interaction history  
- Watchlists and user metadata  

### 5.2 External

- MovieLens dataset (for bootstrapping)  
- IMDb/OMDb APIs for metadata enrichment  

---

## 6. Recommendation Algorithms

### 6.1 Collaborative Filtering (CF)
- **User-Based CF**: Recommend based on similar users  
- **Item-Based CF**: Recommend based on similar movies  

### 6.2 Content-Based Filtering
- Use movie genres, directors, cast, descriptions  

### 6.3 Hybrid Approach
- Combine CF and content-based using weighted average or stacking  

### 6.4 Advanced Techniques (optional)
- Matrix factorization (e.g., SVD)  
- Deep Learning (e.g., autoencoders, Transformers)  
- Reinforcement Learning (for sequential recommendations)

## 7. Data Pipeline

1. Ingestion (user ratings, movie metadata)  
2. ETL/cleaning (handle missing data, normalize formats)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model training and evaluation  
5. Batch/real-time inference  
6. Logging for feedback loop  

---

## 8. Evaluation Metrics

- RMSE / MAE (for explicit ratings)  
- Precision@K / Recall@K / NDCG  
- Coverage, Diversity, Serendipity  
- A/B testing for online performance  


## 12. Future Work

- Social integration (friendsâ€™ watch history)  
- Real-time recommendations  
- Cross-platform history synchronization  
- Multilingual support
